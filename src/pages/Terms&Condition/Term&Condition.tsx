        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, The Grad Story, including its affiliates,
        directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, and licensors, shall not be liable for
        any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including, but not
        limited to, loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of data, loss of business opportunities,
        or any other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection with your use of, or
        inability to use, the Website and Services. This limitation applies regardless of whether
        the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other
        legal theory, and regardless of whether The Grad Story has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Furthermore, in no event shall the total cumulative liability of The Grad Story, its
        affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors for any claims
        arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the use of the Website and Services exceed
        the amount paid by you, if any, to The Grad Story for the Services during the one month
        immediately preceding the event giving rise to such claim.

      <p className="mb-4">
        These limitations and exclusions of liability apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.
        Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain liabilities;
        therefore, some of the above limitations may not apply to you. In such cases, The Grad
        Story's liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
